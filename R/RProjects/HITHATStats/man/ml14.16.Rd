\title{Function to return the ML14-ML16 hydrologic indicator statistics for a given data frame}
\usage{
  ml14.16(qfiletempf)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{data frame containing a "discharge" column
  containing daily flow values}
}
\value{
  ml14.16 list of ml14-ml16 for the given data frame
}
\description{
  This function accepts a data frame that contains columns
  named "discharge" and "year_val" and calculates ML14; the
  minimum annual flow for each year. ML14 is the mean of
  the ratios of minimum annual flows to the median flow for
  each year. ML15; Low flow index. ML15 is the mean of the
  ratios of minimum annual flows to the mean for for each
  year. ML16; Median of annual minimum flows. ML16 is the
  median of the ratios of minimum annual flows to the
  median flow for each year.
