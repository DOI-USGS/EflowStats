\title{Function to compute the seasonal factors (amplitude and phase) for a given data series}
\usage{
seasonality(x, yearType = "water")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe containing a vector of date values in the first column and vector of numeric flow values in the second column.}

\item{yearType}{A charcter of either "water" or "calendar" indicating whether to use water years or calendar years, respectively.}
}
\value{
seasonality vector of seasonal factors (amplitude and phase)
}
\description{
This function accepts a data frame containing daily streamflow data, then computes seasonality 
variables by first standardizing flows, the fitting relation 
A*cos(2*pi*t) + B*sin(2*pi*t)1) Get decimal yearand returns the amplitude and phase
}
\examples{
x <- sampleData[c("date","discharge")]
seasonality(x=x)
}
