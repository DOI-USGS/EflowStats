Dropping the year at the end is likely not intended and is a bug."	"Retain events at start AND end of the record and count their duration even though no true duration can be determined. This will always be an issue as long as stats are calculated on a yearly basis"	"No true duration can be determined for events that did not start or end in the year. However, the bigger issue is dropping the last event in the original method. In particular, If there is only 1 event that spans the entire year, for example there were no flood events and all year is below that threshold, then the entire year gets a 0 event duration because it is dropped as the last event. This introduces a SERIOUS error in the statistic."
