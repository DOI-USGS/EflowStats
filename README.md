EflowStats
===========

ACHTUNG!
----------
There have been major revisions to `EflowStats`!. Please see issues listed in table below.
Currently under development. Careful scrutiny of output is required and output may change at any time.

Overview
----------
Calculates a suite of ecological flow statistics and fundamental properties of daily streamflow for a given set of data. 

The `EflowStats` package was created to simplify the process of generating hydrologic indicator statistics using daily streamflow records. It has been specifically designed to work seamlessly with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) data. This package is intended to be an update of the previously existing USGS National Hydrologic Assessment Tool (NAHAT) program with additional statistics previously published by Archfield et al (Archfield).


Installation
----------
To install this package use the following code:

```r
devtools::install_github("USGS-R/EflowStats")
```

Summary of bugs and updates
---------------------------
There are a number of bugs and/or miscalulated statistics in the original EflowStats R package, which have been corrected here. Below is a table summary of indices that have been identified as being problematic in the original package.

An event at the start of the year is counted while an event that runs to the end of the year is dropped. Dropping the year at the end is likely not intended and is a bug. |Retain events at start AND end of the record and count their duration even though no true duration can be determined. This will always be an issue as long as stats are calculated on a yearly basis |No true duration can be determined for events that did not start or end in the year. However, the bigger issue is dropping the last event in the original method. In particular, If there is only 1 event that spans the entire year, for example there were no flood events and all year is below that threshold, then the entire year gets a 0 event duration because it is dropped as the last event. This introduces a SERIOUS error in the statistic. |
