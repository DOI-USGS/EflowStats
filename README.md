### Package Support

The Water Mission Area of the USGS has supported the development and maintenance of the `EflowStats` R-package. Further maintenance is expected to be stable until further notice. Resources are available primarily for maintenance and responding to user questions. Priorities on the development of new features are determined by the `EflowStats` development team.

### Overview

The `EflowStats` package was created to simplify the process of generating hydrologic indicator statistics using daily streamflow records. It has been specifically designed to work seamlessly with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) data. This package is intended to be an update of the previously existing USGS National Hydrologic Assessment Tool (NAHAT) program with additional statistics previously published by Archfield et al (Archfield).
