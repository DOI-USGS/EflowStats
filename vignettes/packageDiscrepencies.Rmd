This vignette summarizes discrepancies between the statistic calculations in the new (>v1.0) and the old (<v1.0) EflowStats packages. In general, the authors of the new EflowStats package focused primarily on ensuring that the statistics were calculated according to the definitions stated in Henriksen et al, 2006, rather than on reproducing output from previous package versions or the original HITHAT software. This process uncovered a number of issues with the old EflowStats statistics as well as some statistics calculated in the original HITHAT software (Henriksen et al, 2006). A record of this process can be found in the [Closed issues](https://github.com/USGS-R/EflowStats/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) page of the GitHub repository for this package.

## Issues in original HITHAT software

The original HITHAT software contained two bugs in the code that affected a number of the statistics. One bug involved the calculation of monthly means where a single monthly value was returned rather than the mean. This bug affects many statistics that rely on monthly means, such as the MA12-23 statistics. A similar bug was found with 7-day rolling mean calculations and influenced the ML17-18 statistics.

## Old EflowStats package issues

There are a number of discrepancies between the new (v>1.0) and old (v<1.0) EflowStats packages. A list of these by statistic is provided below, but any additional changes to the EflowStats statistics in subsequent versions (>1.0) will be documented in the package _NEWS_ file. 

### DH and DL statistics

There are two changes to the method for calculatings means that affect many of the DH and DL statistics. First, rolling means in the old EflowStats package were calculated on a yearly basis. This makes little sense because rolling means are influenced when the windowing period approaches the beginning or end of the record. By splitting the period of record on year values, it compounds the "edge of record" issue by creating edges for every yearly time series rather than just at the beginning and end of the period of record. The bias can be substantial for longer window (30 and 90-day) rolling means. Thus, rolling means are calculated in the new EflowStats on the entire period of record before splitting the record into yearly time series for subsequent calculations.

A second change affects the DH12-21 statistics. The original documentation in Henriksen et al, 2006 states that the mean should be calculated for the entire period of record. The old EflowStats package calculated the mean of yearly means for the period of record rather than the mean of the entire record. The new EflowStats package calculates the mean of the period of record as the original documentation states.

### MA statistics
Two bugs in the old EflowStats code affect some of the MA statistics. One minor issue caused incorrect rounding for the MA24-35 statistics and has been corrected in the new package. Another bug miscalculated the coefficient of variation and affected the MA3 statistic. This has been corrected in the new package.

### Magnificent Seven statistics
The AR1 coefficient was miscalculated in the old EflowStats package. A bug in the old package caused some of the data to become disordered in time, which substantially influenced the calculation of the AR1 statistic. This has been fixed in the new package (>v1.0). Additionally, the phase calculation in the old EflowStats package was returned in radians, which was not very useful for interpretation. Thus, the value is now returned in units of days in the new (>v1.0) package.

## General changes in the new EflowStats

The majority of the statistics calculated by EflowStats require the data to be sorted in chronological order. The old EflowStats package did not check if the data were sorted appropriately. The new EflowStats package now sorts the data in chronological order by default.

Leap years were not handled appropriately in neither the original HITHAT software nor the old EflowStats package. In both cases, the 366th day of the year was removed during leap years rather than February 29th. This can have an affect on a number of the statistics, albeit small in most cases. The new package now appropriately handles leap years and omits February 29th for statistics that rely on a 365 day year.

To calculate the maximum number of events in a given two month period, the old EflowStats package used fixed 2 month blocks. A more appropriate method is to use a 2-month rolling window. The new EflowStats package uses a 2-month rolling window to calculate statistics that rely on determining the number of events in any given 2 month window, such as the TL3 and TA3 statistics.
