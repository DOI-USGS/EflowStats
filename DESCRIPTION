Description: A reimplementation of the Hydrologic Index Tool 
        (HIT; Henriksen et al, 2006) for calculating 171 hydrologic indices 
        for stream classification analysis. EflowStats also calculates 7 
        additional statistics used for streamflow classification reffered 
        to as the "Magnificent Seven" (MAG7, Archfield et al., 2013). 
        Unlike the original HIT, EflowStats has been redesigned to injest 
        general hydrologic timeseries data and is not restricted to data 
        formats used by the USGS National Water Information System.
